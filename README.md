# Kafka-learning
Simple project to work with Kafka.
Here I wrote the config for interaction with a Kafka server.
Producer's controller has a POST-endpoint through which client can trigger events to the Kafka server.
Consumer listens for new events from a Kafka server, those events can be handled by consumer.
